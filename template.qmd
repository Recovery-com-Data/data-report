-   **Citations and bibliographies** - Seamless integration with reference managers
-   **Multi-language support** - R, Python, Julia, and Observable JavaScript

**Typst** is a modern typesetting system that offers significant advantages over LaTeX:

-   **Faster compilation** - Near-instantaneous document generation
-   **Intuitive syntax** - More readable and maintainable than LaTeX
-   **Better error messages** - Clear diagnostics when issues occur

## Template Features

### Visual Themes

The template supports four different color themes, based on Recovery.com branding. These were designed to allow us to have variance in the look of our report, while keeping a professional look. More themes could be added easily as well.

::: {#fig-themes layout-ncol="2"}
!["forest"](assets/forest.png){width="50%"}

!["ocean"](assets/ocean.png){width="50%"}

!["sunset"](assets/sunset.png){width="50%"}

!["monochrome"](assets/monochrome.png){width="50%"}
:::

### Document Lifecycle Management

The template allows simple document status tracking through watermarks and metadata display:

**Status Watermarks** - Diagonal watermarks appear on content pages (not title page) - Common values: `DRAFT`, `REVIEW`, `CONFIDENTIAL`, `PRELIMINARY` - Automatically excluded for final documents

**Version Control** - **Editions**: Major revisions (`"First Edition"`, `"Q3 2025 Report"`) - **Versions**: Minor updates (`"1.0"`, `"1.2"`, `"2.1"`) - Smart display: Editions on title page, versions in headers

### Typography and Layout

The template uses professional typography with carefully selected font families:

-   **Body text**: Avenir (clean, readable sans-serif)
-   **Headings**: Avenir with strategic weight variations
-   **Display text**: Fields Variable (elegant serif for titles)
-   **Responsive sizing**: Scales appropriately for different content types

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Compilation Errors** - Check YAML syntax for proper indentation - Verify font paths are correct - Ensure image files exist at specified paths

**Typst-Specific Problems** - Array operations use `+` for concatenation, not `push()` - Color values must be properly formatted RGB - Layout functions require proper context blocks
